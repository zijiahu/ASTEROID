# ASTEROID
This is a game built by using Processing. This game allows users to have an interactive experience by driving a spaceship. The essential idea behind this game is to avoid and shoot asteroids. Use the directional keys on your keyboard to control the spaceship. Use space bar on your keyboard to fire the bullets and shoot the asteroids. Be careful with the asteroids! If the spaceship collides with asteroids, the game will end. 

The inspiration of this game is the classic asteroid game I played when I was in primary school.

Let's see how long you can play!
